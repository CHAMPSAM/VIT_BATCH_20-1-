Industrial Fire Safety System

## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**
To develop a prototype system which can generate and evacuate the workers under fire accident.
Developing a prototype system for generating and evacuating workers under a fire accident addresses a critical safety concern, and its scope can have wide-ranging implications. Here are two aspects to consider regarding the scope of such a solution:

### 1. **Safety and Emergency Response:**
   - **Immediate Impact:** The primary focus would be on ensuring the safety of workers in the event of a fire. The prototype should have mechanisms for rapid detection of a fire and initiating an evacuation procedure.
   - **Enhanced Response Time:** The system should aim to reduce the time it takes to detect a fire, alert workers, and initiate evacuation, thereby minimizing the risk of injuries and fatalities.

### 2. **Technological Integration:**
   - **Sensor Integration:** The prototype might involve integrating various sensors (smoke detectors, heat sensors, etc.) to detect the fire promptly.
   - **Communication Systems:** It should incorporate robust communication systems to quickly alert workers and emergency response teams.
